# SpaceInvader-like-Game

This is a game based on Space Invaders with a theme of Filthy Frank.

The player starts at the bottom with rows of enemies at the top. The enemies move slightly left to right while also 
moving downwards while the player can only move horizontally. 

The player has to shoot all of the enemies before any of them make contact with the bottom-most wall which is below the player.
The game also ends if an alien makes contact with the player.
